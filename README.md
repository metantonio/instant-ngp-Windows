Ever wanted to train a NeRF model of a fox in under 5 seconds? Or fly around a scene captured from photos of a factory robot? Of course you have!

Here you will find an implementation of four __neural graphics primitives__, being neural radiance fields (NeRF), signed distance functions (SDFs), neural images, and neural volumes.
In each case, we train and render a MLP with multiresolution hash input encoding using the [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn) framework.

## Requirements
- An __NVIDIA GPU__; tensor cores increase performance when available. All shown results come from an RTX 3090.
- [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Latest the best, ~8GB) Below are the install requirements
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29135514/151634222-6ac236c9-5fa7-4762-9144-73e50959cb65.png)
- __[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exe_network) v11.6__. You can check ur CUDA version via `nvcc --version` in any prompt and if it's not CUDA11.6, refer to [this](https://github.com/bycloudai/SwapCudaVersionWindows) to swap/install the correct version. 
- On some machines, `pyexr` refuses to install via `pip`. This can be resolved by installing OpenEXR from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#openexr). See later.
- __[OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix) 7.3 or higher__ for faster mesh SDF training. You need to either login or join to obtain the installer. Set the system environment variables `OptiX_INSTALL_DIR` to the installation directory if it is not discovered automatically. Should look like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29135514/151631220-7a934f5c-c299-41ab-a44e-184e2dc142b9.png)

## Compilation

copy these files `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.6\extras\visual_studio_integration\MSBuildExtensions`
to here `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v160\BuildCustomizations`

Begin by cloning this repository and all its submodules using the following command:
```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/nvlabs/instant-ngp
$ cd instant-ngp
```

Then, open **Developer Command Prompt**, you can find this in your search bar.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29135514/151631759-ff8538ab-74c6-4c7b-962e-d7b097e819db.png)

Then `cd` to where you cloned your repository so you are in its root folder `/instant-ng/`:
```sh
cmake . -B build
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo -j 16
```

If the any of these build fails, please consult [this list of possible fixes](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp#troubleshooting-compile-errors) before opening an issue.

If automatic GPU architecture detection fails, (as can happen if you have multiple GPUs installed), set the  `TCNN_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` enivonment variable for the GPU you would like to use. The following table lists the values for common GPUs. If your GPU is not listed, consult [this exhaustive list](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

| RTX 30X0 | A100 | RTX 20X0 | TITAN V / V100 | GTX 10X0 / TITAN Xp | GTX 9X0 | K80 |
|----------|------|----------|----------------|---------------------|---------|-----|
|       86 |   80 |       75 |             70 |                  61 |      52 |  37 |


## Interactive Training and Rendering on Custom Image Sets
Install [COLMAP](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/releases/tag/3.7), I used ver 3.7

Add it to your system environment variables at Environment Variables > System Variables Path > Edit environment variable

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29135514/151633058-e45f9220-c417-4249-aff3-09d29c1a4e9b.png)

open anaconda prompt, if you don't have you don't have you can get it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
`cd` into isntant-ngp as root
```sh
conda create -n ngp python=3.9
conda activate ngp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if `pyexr` cannot be installed via `pip install pyexr`, download [OpenEXR‑1.3.2‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#openexr) and move it to your root folder. Then you can run:
```
pip install OpenEXR-1.3.2-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
```
Place your custom image set under `data/<image_set_name>`

Get `transform.json` from the following command. Insert your path to your images at `<image/path>`
```sh
python scripts/colmap2nerf.py --colmap_matcher exhaustive --run_colmap --aabb_scale 16 --images <image/path>
```
`transform.json` will be generated at the root folder, drag and drop it into your `data/<image_set_name>` folder.

You have to reorganize the folder structure due to how `transform.json` is created...

For example:

File Structure **BEFORE** generating transform.json
```
📂instant-ngp/ # this is root
├── 📂data/
│	├── 📂toy_truck/
│	│	├── 📜toy_truck_001.jpg
│	│	├── 📜toy_truck_002.jpg
│	│	│...
│   │...
│...
```

File Structure **AFTER** generating transform.json
```
📂instant-ngp/ # this is root
├── 📂data/
│	├── 📂toy_truck/
│	├── 📜transform.json/
│	│	├── 📂data/
│	│	│	├── 📂toy_truck/
│	│	│	│	├── 📜toy_truck_001.jpg
│	│	│	│	├── 📜toy_truck_002.jpg
│	│	│	│	│...
│	│	│	│...
│	│	│...
│	│...
│...
```
Note: adjusting the `"aabb_scale"` inside `transform.json` can reduce load on GPU VRAM. The lower the value the less intensive it'll be. 


Finally, to run instant-ngp: 
```sh
<path_to_your_ngp>\instant-ngp\build\testbed.exe --scene data/<image_set_name>
```
eg.
```
C:\user\user\download\instant-ngp\build\testbed.exe --scene data/toy_truck
```

And it should launch the GUI and everything amazing with it, and my fork edits end here.


## Interactive training and rendering

<img src="docs/assets_readme/testbed.png" width="100%"/>

This codebase comes with an interactive testbed that includes many features beyond our academic publication:
- Additional training features, such as extrinsics and intrinsics optimization.
- Marching cubes for `NeRF->Mesh` and `SDF->Mesh` conversion.
- A spline-based camera path editor to create videos.
- Debug visualizations of the activations of every neuron input and output.
- And many more task-specific settings.
- See also our [one minute demonstration video of the tool](https://nvlabs.github.io/instant-ngp/assets/mueller2022instant.mp4).



### NeRF fox

One test scene is provided in this repository, using a small number of frames from a casually captured phone video:

```sh
instant-ngp$ build\testbed --scene data/nerf/fox --width 640 --height 480
```

<img src="docs/assets_readme/fox.png"/>

Alternatively, download any NeRF-compatible scene (e.g. [from the NeRF authors' drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDdLGDruGNXWnM1eqY1FNL9PlStjaKWi)).
Now you can run:

```sh
instant-ngp$ build\testbed --scene data/nerf_synthetic/lego/transforms_train.json
```

For more information about preparing datasets for use with our NeRF implementation, please see [this document](docs/nerf_dataset_tips.md).

### SDF armadillo

```sh
instant-ngp$ .\build\testbed --scene data/sdf/armadillo.obj
```

<img src="docs/assets_readme/armadillo.png"/>

### Image of Einstein

```sh
instant-ngp$ .\build\testbed --scene data/image/albert.exr
```

<img src="docs/assets_readme/albert.png"/>

To reproduce the gigapixel results, download, for example, [the Tokyo image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/trevor_dobson_inefekt69/29314390837) and convert it to `.bin` using the `scripts/image2bin.py` script. This custom format improves compatibility and loading speed when resolution is high. Now you can run:

```sh
instant-ngp$ ./build/testbed --scene data/image/tokyo.bin
```


### Volume Renderer

Download the [nanovdb volume for the Disney cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SuycSAOSG64k2KLV7oWgyNWyCvZAkafK?usp=sharing), which is derived [from here](https://disneyanimation.com/data-sets/?drawer=/resources/clouds/) ([CC BY-SA 3.0](https://media.disneyanimation.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/6/asset/License_Cloud.pdf)).

```sh
instant-ngp$ ./build/testbed --mode volume --scene data/volume/wdas_cloud_quarter.nvdb
```
<img src="docs/assets_readme/cloud.png"/>


## Python bindings

To conduct controlled experiments in an automated fashion, all features from the interactive testbed (and more!) have Python bindings that can be easily instrumented.
For an example of how the `./build/testbed` application can be implemented and extended from within Python, see `./scripts/run.py`, which supports a superset of the command line arguments that `./build/testbed` does.

Happy hacking!


## Troubleshooting compile errors

Before investigating further, make sure all submodules are up-to-date and try compiling again.
```sh
instant-ngp$ git submodule sync --recursive
instant-ngp$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
If __instant-ngp__ still fails to compile, update CUDA as well as your compiler to the latest versions you can install on your system. It is crucial that you update _both_, as newer CUDA versions are not always compatible with earlier compilers and vice versa.
If your problem persists, consult the following table of known issues.

| Problem | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| __CMake error:__ No CUDA toolset found / CUDA_ARCHITECTURES is empty for target "cmTC_0c70f" | __Windows:__ the Visual Studio CUDA integration was not installed correctly. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2/issues/103#issuecomment-618378963) to fix the problem without re-installing CUDA. ([#18](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/18)) |
| | __Linux:__ Environment variables for your CUDA installation are probably incorrectly set. You may work around the issue using ```cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda-<your cuda version>/bin/nvcc``` ([#28](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/28)) |
| __CMake error:__ No known features for CXX compiler "MSVC" | Reinstall Visual Studio & make sure you run CMake from a developer shell. ([#21](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/21)) |
| __Compile error:__ undefined references to "cudaGraphExecUpdate" / identifier "cublasSetWorkspace" is undefined | Update your CUDA installation (which is likely 11.0) to 11.3 or higher. ([#34](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/34) [#41](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/41) [#42](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/42)) |
| __Compile error:__ too few arguments in function call | Update submodules with the above two `git` commands. ([#37](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/37) [#52](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/52)) |
| __Python error:__ No module named 'pyngp' | It is likely that CMake did not detect your Python installation and therefore did not build `pyngp`. Check CMake logs to verify this. If `pyngp` was built in a different folder than `instant-ngp/build`, Python will be unable to detect it and you have to supply the full path to the import statement. ([#43](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/43)) |

If you cannot find your problem in the table, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/new) and ask for help.
